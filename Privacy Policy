1. General Provisions
This Privacy Policy governs the processing and protection of personal data of users of the Lyrica mobile app (hereinafter referred to as the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

1.1. Personal Data Controller
The personal data controller is the App developer:

Igor Andreevich Vasserman
Status: Self-employed
Contact email for inquiries regarding personal data processing: iva28app@gmail.com

The Operator is not a legal entity and processes personal data as part of the development and support of the Lyrica mobile app.

2. Grounds and Purposes of Personal Data Processing
Personal data is processed on the following grounds:


– User consent, provided by using the App, registering an account, or using its functionality
– Necessity to perform and maintain the services provided by the App, including subscription features

Purposes of personal data processing:

– Providing the functionality of the Lyrica mobile app
– Ensuring the Lyrica+++ subscription and processing payments
– Synchronizing data between the user’s devices
– Providing technical support and improving the App
– Ensuring security and preventing fraud
– Complying with applicable legal requirements

3. Collected Data
When using the App, we may collect the following data:



– Authentication data: When signing in via Google or Yandex, we receive a user ID and basic profile information (such as name and email) through authentication services
– User content: Lyrics, notes, tags, and other data created by the user within the App
– Metadata: Information related to subscriptions and purchases, synchronization settings, and technical logs used to improve the App
– Anti-fraud technical identifiers (hashed): to prevent abuse of the trial period and protect against fraud, we may process and store a hash of your email and/or a hash of a device identifier. For this purpose, we do not store the “raw” device identifier on our server; only hashed values are used.

We do not collect or store bank card details. Payment information is entered and processed directly by the payment provider in accordance with its own security standards.

4. Data Storage
User data may be stored using the following services:

– Authentication and user profile services
– Cloud storage services for synchronizing lyrics, notes, audio files, and other user data
– Local storage on the user’s device for caching and offline access

5. Personal Data Retention Periods
Personal data is stored for as long as the user uses the App and/or maintains an account, and until the user deletes the data or the account. Some data may be retained longer if necessary to fulfill legal obligations or to protect the legitimate interests of the operator, such as handling user requests or resolving payment-related issues.
Hashed anti-fraud identifiers (such as email/device hashes) used to limit trial eligibility and prevent abuse may be retained after account deletion for a reasonable period necessary to achieve these purposes.

Cloud data retention and automatic deletion:
If the User has uploaded or synchronized content to the cloud and does not have an active Pro Subscription (including after a trial period or after the paid period ends), the Operator may automatically delete such cloud content after 90 (ninety) days of inactivity/absence of an active Pro Subscription. This does not affect local data stored on the User’s device. Certain billing-related records may be retained longer to comply with legal obligations and to resolve payment-related issues.


6. Sharing Data with Third Parties
We do not sell personal data to third parties. Data may be shared only with service providers necessary for the operation of the App, including:

– Authentication and analytics services
– Subscription and payment management services (which do not receive the contents of user-generated text or notes)
– Cloud storage providers used to store and synchronize user data

All such services process data in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable data protection standards.

7. User Rights
Users have the right to:

– Receive information about the personal data being processed
– Access their personal data
– Request correction of inaccurate or outdated data
– Delete their data and/or account using the App’s features or by contacting support
– Withdraw consent to data processing (which may limit the availability of certain App features)

Requests related to personal data will be reviewed within a reasonable period. If additional time is required, the user will be informed accordingly.

To exercise these rights, please contact: iva28app@gmail.com

8. Data Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction. Data transmission is secured using encrypted connections, and access to infrastructure is restricted.


9. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the App or by other appropriate means.
